Hi there. I'm Suryansh Shakya â€” currently a 2nd-year undergrad at BITS Pilani, studying Computer Science.

I build intelligent systems that can learn and adapt â€” ideas inspired by the brain, built using deep learning. These days, Iâ€™m diving deep into topics like:

- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI)

Lately, Iâ€™ve gone back to the roots, relearning deep learning from the ground up. Iâ€™m also quite fascinated by how the brain works, and how we might one day bridge the gap between machines and minds (Brain-Computer Interfaces, if you will).

When I'm not buried in code, Iâ€™m busy building **Hawks Lab**, a small space for my experiments and projects. Most of itâ€™s open source â€” feel free to poke around.

I enjoy working on:
- Machine Learning
- Web Dev (when itâ€™s not fighting me)
- Side projects that spiral out of control

You can reach me here:

Fun fact: I started coding way back in 3rd grade. Havenâ€™t stopped since.


WHY THIS BLOG?
--------------

This blog is a public notebook of sorts. Iâ€™m restarting my journey into deep learning and using this space to jot down thoughts, share notes, run experiments, and occasionally rant when things break.

Itâ€™s not meant to be polished or perfect. If you're also trying to make sense of neural networks, transformers, or why your model wonâ€™t converge â€” you might feel at home here.

Focus areas:
- NLP (mostly)
- Computer Vision
- Speech processing (eventually)

Beginners welcome. Experts too â€” but no jargon for the sake of sounding smart.


OTHER STUFF
-----------

I care about open source. I try to give back where I can â€” usually by sharing things I build or breaking stuff so you donâ€™t have to.

Thatâ€™s it for now. Thanks for stopping by.  
Youâ€™re always welcome to read, explore, or say hello.
